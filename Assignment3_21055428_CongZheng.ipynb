        "Sparse matrix vector multiplication (SpMV) is not negligible in the field of scientific computing, such as iterative methods for solving linear systems and eigenvalue problems. The performance of SpMV is largely determined by the format of the sparse matrix, which is a standard format widely used on CPUs. However, it has some serious drawbacks on the GPU and also on modern vector extensions to the CPU (AVX etc.). The Ellpack-R format, on the other hand, improves on the shortcomings of CSR on the GPU and offers higher performance on these devices.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this solution, we explore the performance of the GPU-based Ellpack-R format for sparse matrix multiplication. First, in Chapter 2 we summarise the shortcomings of the CSR format based on the literature of Vazquez et. al and explain the advantages of the Ellpack and Ellpack-R counterparts, and further describe the subsequent directions of development. Afterwards, in Chapter 3, we first build a new class of EllpackMatrix based on Ellpack-R for implementing matrix vector multiplication and perform a benchmark comparison using random sparse matrices, discrete Poisson matrices and other matrices.\n",

        "Sparse matrices have found specific applications in many engineering fields. In real production environments, the most efficient storage solution is to store only the non-zero elements of the matrix in order to save memory. And the main bottleneck for iterative solution of specific engineering systems is the sparse matrix-vector multiplication method, which is used repeatedly until the iterative process reaches convergence. The advent of the GPU has made it possible to break the performance limit of SpMV computation. Therefore, it is important to design a sparse matrix storage format that can be efficiently utilised in GPUs."

When matrices are stored out of order, SpMV calculations based on the COO format are not suitable for GPU architectures.

When the number of non-zeros in each row is almost equal, the number of zeros to be filled is reduced, which leads to high performance in achieving SpMV on the GPU. However, when the number of non-zeros in each row differs by a large amount, more zeros need to be filled, which leads to a reduction in computational performance.\n",

        "\n",
        "In this solution, we explored the performance of the GPU-based Ellpack-R format for sparse matrix multiplication, and created a new class of Ellpack-R-based EllpackMatrix for implementing matrix vector multiplication, and benchmarked it against other matrices using random sparse matrices, discrete Poisson matrices and others. The comparison results prove the correctness of the solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "According to the validation results, the CPU-based CSR format for SpMV computation has superior computational performance compared to the CUDA-based Ellpack-R format. When the matrix size is 2500, the SpMV operation in CSR format is about a thousand times faster. This is probably due to the fact that SpMV in CSR format has been developed and optimised over many years and has a much better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to time constraints, the performance comparison between the CUDA-based CSR format and the Ellpack-R format is not discussed in this solution, and no further optimisation of SpMV was performed using shared memory. Therefore, designing better storage formats to improve the performance of large-scale sparse matrices on GPUs is one of the future directions."
